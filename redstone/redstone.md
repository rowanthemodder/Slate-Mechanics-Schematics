# Redstone

This contains a bunch of redstone contraptions that I thought might prove useful to other people!

## [Solid State Analog Controller](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/blob/main/redstone/solid_state_analog_controller.nbt)
This nifty little thing outputs an analog signal that can be moved up or down with a redstone signal!
It doesn't break when shifting both up and down at the same time, and can take both a short or extended pulse.
