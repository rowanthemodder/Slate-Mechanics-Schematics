# Trains

### Large
Large trains are the biggest of the bunch!
The locomotive breaks 1 track in front of it when building so account for that.

### Medium
Medium trains have nothing too special, but I feel they're the sweet spot in size.

### Small
Small trains are cute and short little things, good for small spaces where large track turns aren't possible.

### Mini
These trains are designed for manual or factory use, they're tiny!

### Tracks
This contains track templates intended for trains that need a *lot* of turning space.

### Loaders & Unloaders
This has designs for all the loading and unloading needs for all the trains!

### Station Redstone
This is still getting filled out, but for now it has a noteblock setup for train arrivals!
