# Trains

## [Large trains](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/tree/main/trains/large)
These are the biggest of the bunch and some come in multiple colors!
The locomotive breaks 1 track in front of it when building so account for that.

## [Medium trains](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/tree/main/trains/medium)
They have nothing too special, but I feel they're the sweet spot in size.

## [Small trains](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/tree/main/trains/small)
Cute and short little things, good for small spaces where large track turns aren't possible.

## [Mini trains](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/tree/main/trains/mini)
Designed for manual or factory use, they're tiny!

## [Tracks](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/tree/main/trains/tracks)
Contains track templates intended for trains that need a *lot* of turning space.

## [Loaders & unloaders](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/tree/main/trains/loaders_%26_unloaders)
This has designs for all the loading and unloading needs for every train!

## [Station redstone](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/tree/main/trains/station_redstone)
Still getting filled out, but for now it has a noteblock setup for train arrivals!
