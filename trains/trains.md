# Trains

### Large
[Large trains](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/tree/main/trains/large) are the biggest of the bunch!
The locomotive breaks 1 track in front of it when building so account for that.

### Medium
[Medium trains](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/tree/main/trains/medium) have nothing too special, but I feel they're the sweet spot in size.

### Small
[Small trains](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/tree/main/trains/small) are cute and short little things, good for small spaces where large track turns aren't possible.

### Mini
[Mini trains](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/tree/main/trains/mini) are designed for manual or factory use, they're tiny!

### Tracks
[The tracks folder](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/tree/main/trains/tracks) contains track templates intended for trains that need a *lot* of turning space.

### Loaders & Unloaders
[Loaders & unloaders](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/tree/main/trains/loaders_%26_unloaders) has designs for all the loading and unloading needs for every train!

### Station Redstone
[Station redstone](https://github.com/rowanthemodder/Slate-Mechanics-Schematics/tree/main/trains/station_redstone) is still getting filled out, but for now it has a noteblock setup for train arrivals!
